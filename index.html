	<p id="p1"><b>Tata Indigo is a class of sub-compact and sedan cars manufactured by Indian automobile company Tata Motors. The first generation of the Indigo, which was launched in the Indian market in 2002, is based on the Tata Indica, a sub-compact hatchback. The two cars shared a similar design, while the Indigo had a higher wheelbase, a 450-litre trunk, and turbocharged-diesel and petrol engine options. The car received its first design refresh in 2006, giving it distinguishing features from the Indica, such as more upmarket double-barreled headlamps, front fog-lamps, more upmarket interiors with fabric upholstery, etc. </b></p>
